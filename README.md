Here you can see beginner level exercices together with one possible solution:
### 1. If there are two lists l1 and l2 with the following strings, use the combination of l1 and l2 to print as follows.
### 2. The person dictionary is defined as follows. Add a new item to this person dictionary with the key 'Father' and the value 'John Doe'. And then print the person dictionary.
### 3. With tuple data, the values of two variables can be swapped without using a temporary variable. Using this swapping method, write a program that moves the largest value in the given list to the last.
### 4. The two-dimensional array a contains the values [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]. Change this two-dimensional array to a onedimensional array like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and print it out.
### 5. There is a dictionary variable maria as follows. In this dictionary variable, courses such as ‘korean' and ‘english' and their scores are stored as key:value. Print the average score of 89.25 for maria's subject scores.
### 6. Declare a nested dictionary school as follows. Next, use the deepcopy() function of the copy module to write a program that 'copy' to another variable, school2. (Check that school and school2 are different variables through the is operator.)
### 7. There is a scores tuple as follows. This tuple contains information about four students, including each student's name and English, math, and science grades. For example, ‘Hyun’ has an English score of 88, a math score of 95, and a science score of 90. Extract only math scores by unpacking the scores tuple. Write a code that calculates the average of these extracted math scores.
